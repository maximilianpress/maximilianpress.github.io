	<h1>Hi, my name is max.</h1> 
        <p class="lead">I am a computational biologist/bioinformatician and human. I like simple tools, plants, and other useful devices.</p>	
         
        <h2>Currently, </h2>
        <p>I am currently a bioinformatician for Phase Genomics Inc., where I work on methods for analyzing host ranges of mobile elements in complex microbial communities.</p>

        <h2>Science stuff</h2>
        <p> Previously, I did my graduate work and a short postdoc studying a grab bag of topics in genetics and genomics, including such random things as:</p>

        <ol><li>Why some bacteria can gain a gene and others can't (my answer: not all of them remembered to upgrade their operating systems).</li>

        <li>Microsatellites are weird and probably more important than we want to admit.</li>

        <li>"Epistasis" is a word meaning "we don't understand the causal basis of any genotype-phenotype relationship".</li>

        <li>Plants grown at high temperatures are bad at telling time.</li>

   
	    
        <h2>Code etc.:</h2>

	<p>I invite you to look at my <a href="https://github.com/maximilianpress">github</a>. Note that the majority of my private-sector code is not available.</p>    

	<h2>Official docs:</h2>
	
	<p><a href="https://github.com/maximilianpress/PRESS_CV/blob/master/Press_CV_2020_academic.pdf">My CV (pdf).</a></p>
	
	<p><a href="https://github.com/maximilianpress/gs_thesis/blob/master/observations-effects-epistasis/main.pdf">My dissertation (pdf).</a></p>
	
	<p>If you want to read papers I've published, try <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o76x5xQAAAAJ">google scholar.</a></p>

    <p>I have <a href="https://osf.io/2qrk6/">an OSF account </a>, which has a bunch of materials for the papers that I've published.</p>

	<h2>Side projects</h2>
        <p><a href="https://maximilianpress.github.io/projects/">I occasionally update a page with some stuff I'm working on..</a></p>
        <li>German-English translation of old genetics literature.</li>
        <li>A work-in-progress repeat inference toolkit based on k-mers and simple-minded algorithm.</li>
        <li>I'm contributing to PhageTerm, a tool for annotating and finishing phage genomes. The official tool will be released by the main team at Pasteur (led by Julian Garneau),but in the meantime there is a Python3-compatible version <a href="https://github.com/maximilianpress/phageterm">on my github</a>.</li> 
       
        <h2>Throwaway stuff:</h2>
	<p>I sometimes yell at the internet about science <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process">in other people's articles</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/@iusewords/">in my own.</a></p>
	
	<p>I occasionally maintain a <a href="https://twitter.com/EurovizhnWisdom">silly twitterbot.</a></p>
	
    <p><a href="https://maximilianpress.github.io/projects/">Some current side projects.</a></p>
