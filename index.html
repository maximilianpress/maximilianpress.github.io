	<h1>Hi, my name is max.</h1> 
	
	<p class="lead">I am currently a bioinformatician for Phase Genomics Inc., where I work on methods for finding whole microbial genomes in complex microbial communities.</p>

    <p> Previously, I did my graduate work and a short postdoc studying a grab bag of topics in genetics and genomics, including such random things as:</p>

    <ol><li>Why some bacteria can gain a gene and others can't (my answer: not all of them remembered to upgrade their operating systems).</li>

    <li>Microsatellites are weird and probably more important than we want to admit.</li>

    <li>"Epistasis" is a word meaning "we don't understand the causal basis of any genotype-phenotype".</li>

    <li>Plants grown at high temperatures are bad at telling time.</li>

	<h2>Official docs:</h2>
	
	<p><a href="https://github.com/maximilianpress/PRESS_CV/blob/master/Press_CV_2018_academic.pdf">My CV (pdf).</a></p>
	
	<p><a href="https://github.com/maximilianpress/gs_thesis/blob/master/observations-effects-epistasis/main.pdf">My dissertation (pdf).</a></p>
	
	<p>If you want to read papers I've published, try <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o76x5xQAAAAJ">google scholar.</a></p>

    <p>I have <a href="https://osf.io/2qrk6/">an OSF account </a>, which has a bunch of materials for the papers that I've published.</p>

	<h2>Other things:</h2>
	<p>I sometimes yell at the internet about science <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process">in other people's articles</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/@iusewords/">in my own.</a></p>
	
	<p>I maintain a <a href="https://twitter.com/EurovizhnWisdom">silly twitterbot.</a></p>
	
	<h4>Some current side projects:</h4>
	
    <ol><li>A <a href="https://github.com/maximilianpress/miscellaneous/blob/master/experimental-investigations-variation.pdf">translation</a> (in progress) into English of Richard Woltereck's 1909 article containing the first description of reaction norms, and coining of the term ("Reaktionsnorm"). </li>
	
	<li>Some thoughts on how science advances and the efficacy of academic science in making these advances, using for instance the example of Grigori Perelman.</li>
