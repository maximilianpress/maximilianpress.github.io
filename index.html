	<h2>Hi, my name is max.</h2> 
        <p> I am a computational biologist/bioinformatician (15 years' experience) and moderately ok human.</p>
        <p> I like simple tools, plants, my family, and being outside. </p>
         
        <h3>In industry (~10 years in startups): </h3>
        <p>Right now, I'm at Nautilus. I've worked on statistical modeling of affinity reagent behavior, experimentalist-facing infrastructure, production pipeline database interactions, experimental design, deconvolution algorithm benchmarking, and all kinds of stuff.</p>
        <p>I previously worked as a bioinformatician for Inscripta, solving biological problems with computers to make genome engineering easier. I specialized in detecting weird stuff.</p>
        <p>Before that, I worked for Phase Genomics Inc., working on computational methods for analyzing host ranges of mobile elements in complex microbial communities.</p>

        <h3>Science stuff</h3>
        <p> I did my graduate work and a short postdoc studying a grab bag of topics in genetics and genomics, including such random things as:</p>

        <ol><li>Why some bacteria can gain a gene and others can't (my answer: not all of them remembered to upgrade their operating systems).</li>

        <li>Microsatellites are weird and probably more important than we want to admit.</li>

        <li>"Epistasis" is a word meaning "we don't understand the causal basis of any genotype-phenotype relationship".</li>

        <li>Plants grown at high temperatures are bad at telling time.</li></ol>   
	    
        <h3>Code etc.:</h3>
  <p>Note that the vast majority of my private-sector code is not publicly available.</p>
	<p>If you want a sample of some small projects that I'm not particularly proud of, you can look at my <a href="https://github.com/maximilianpress">github</a>.</p>    

	<h3>Official docs:</h3>

	<p><a href="https://github.com/maximilianpress/gs_thesis/blob/master/observations-effects-epistasis/main.pdf">My dissertation (pdf).</a></p>
	<p>If you want to read papers I've published, try <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o76x5xQAAAAJ">google scholar.</a></p>
  <p>I have <a href="https://osf.io/2qrk6/">an OSF account </a>, which has a bunch of materials for the papers that I've published.</p>
  <p>I have a resume that I can share if you ask nicely like a human.</p>

	<h3>Side projects (old)</h3>
        <p><a href="https://maximilianpress.github.io/projects/">I occasionally update a page with some stuff I'm working on.</a></p>
        <li>German-English translation of old genetics literature.</li>
        <li>A work-in-progress repeat inference toolkit based on k-mers and simple-minded algorithm.</li>
        <li>Assorted scientific OSS. For example, a few years ago I contributed to PhageTerm, a tool for annotating and finishing phage genomes.</li> 
       
        <h3>Throwaway stuff:</h3>
        <p>I answer questions on Biology and Bioinformatics StackExchange sites, where I've been a top 10 contributor for the past several years.</p>	
        <p>Support your <a href="https://www.wnps.org/"> local native plant society</a>.</p>
